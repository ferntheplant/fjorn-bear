# Fjorn's new blog

The blog is now hosted via [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/) for its simplicity and ease of use.

TODO: upgrade to premium to point to fjorn.dev

## Writing a new blog post

TODO: setup script to create new markdown file in `blogs/` with frontmatter filled out. Specifically have `make_discoverable: false` to turn off the toast upvote thing.

Once a blog post is written publish it through the Bear UI by copy-pasting the markdown (including frontmatter) into the provided textarea. Copy-paste the frontmatter into the "wal-mart" brand frontmatter section of the Bear UI and leave a single `---` line at the top of the blog post content.

## Styling

Copy and paste the `theme.css` file into the styling theme on the [Bear Dashboard](https://bearblog.dev/dashboard/).
TODO: restructure the css and commend it for future me
